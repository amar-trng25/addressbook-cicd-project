<p style="color:blue;"><h2>Science is the systematic study of the natural world through observation, experimentation, and reasoning. It helps us understand how the universe works—from the smallest particles to the vastness of space. Science is based on evidence and follows a methodical process known as the scientific method, which involves asking questions, forming hypotheses, conducting experiments, analyzing results, and drawing conclusions.

Science is divided into several major branches, including:

Physical science (e.g., physics and chemistry),Life science (e.g., biology),

Earth and space science (e.g., geology and astronomy),

Social science (e.g., psychology and sociology).

The goal of science is not just to gain knowledge, but to apply that knowledge in ways that benefit society—such as developing new technologies, improving health, and solving global challenges.</h2></p>
